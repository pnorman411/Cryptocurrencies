# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

Unsupervised machine learning was used to analyze which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for an investment.  Pandas was used to preprocess the dataset, the PCA algorithm and K-means algorithm were used, an elbow curve created, and hvplot was used to create a scatter plot to visualize the clusters.

## Results

### Elbow Curve finding the best value for k; running K-Means with k=4


### 3D-Scatter with the PCA data and clusters


### hvplot.scatter that shows the CoinName when hovering over the data point
